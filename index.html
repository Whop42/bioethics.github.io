        <p>Our group strongly believes that illegal organ harvesting be illegal. This is because illegal organ harvesting is both unethincal and dangerous for both the donor and the recipinet. This is because when organs are harvested illegally, you do not know who and in what conditions the organ was taken out, and how it was handled before being transplanted. Illegal organ harvesting and transplant also preys on people who have less money. THis is because people with less money are willing to sell their organs to make ends meet, and rich people buy the organs off of the poor people. The root to this problem is the fact that there are not that many organs available for transplant. To fix this problem, we need to make selling organs legal. You may think this will accelerate the process of people doing shady things, you are wrong. There are many people in the world that believe that they have a right to sell their own organs. So, if we combine these things together, we can make a legal and licensed organ market. If we do this, we will get more organ that we can give to people who are in need.</p>
